Began on the service function implementation. There are two options for making the options more
ergonomic to use for a developer. The first is the way I would default to if I were in another
language. The second is to use the builder pattern for the request, which would have in its
methods ways to control all the features of the API in a compact way. I can also introduce a default
implementation which can facilitate the convenience function.

Committed my first works on the service function. Close to completion.
