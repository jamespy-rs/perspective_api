# 2100

Made a lot of progress on error handling and testing. I am putting more effort into the modelling of the API in
Rust than I probably need to, but it is useful to separate the concerns of the API representation and what Arwen
wants to do with it, which will come in the service.

There are four tests which now pass.

There are still lots of warnings, but the Perspective-facing contract is functional.
The next step is to build the Arwen-facing API, emulating the typescript function and its specifics.
