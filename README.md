# perspective_api
An unopinionated client and a somewhat opinionated service for the Perspective API.

Activate the service feature for some extra convenience.

Version 1.0.0 is released now. I have aimed at an MVP to begin. There is another endpoint not yet implemented, and a command line version is also not yet implemented.
